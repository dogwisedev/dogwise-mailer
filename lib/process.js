/**
 * Process a single contact record ({ id, properties }).
 * Returns { status: 'sent'|'completed'|'skipped'|'replied'|'error', detail? }
 *
 * WHY THIS WRAPPER EXISTS.
 * Everything from the campaign lookup through owner/region resolution and reply
 * detection runs BEFORE the skipStep/retryOrSkip helpers exist (they are defined lower
 * down, next to the SMS block, because they close over `base`/`advance` which are only
 * built once a step is known to be sendable). A throw anywhere in that earlier stretch —
 * a HubSpot API error, a bad association lookup, anything — used to propagate straight
 * out of processContact with dw_next_send untouched. The contact stayed due, the cron
 * picked it up again in 5 minutes, it failed identically, forever. That is what produced
 * a long, unbroken column of "error" rows with no channel and no From: failures from
 * before `base` (which carries sender/channel) was ever constructed.
 *
 * This bounds EVERY failure, wherever it originates, using the same per-step attempt
 * counter the send paths already use. After MAX_ATTEMPTS, dw_next_send is cleared so the
 * contact drops out of the due queue rather than spinning — a blunt stop rather than a
 * clean "skip to next step", because at this level we cannot assume how far execution got.
 * A human can re-enroll deliberately; nothing keeps retrying unattended overnight.
